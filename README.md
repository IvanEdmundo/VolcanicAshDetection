# VolcanicAshDetection
Master Thesis Project

This repositroy shows the code that I used in my Master Thesis Project. In this work, neural networks have been used for the identification of volcanic ash clouds through multispectral measurements of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Different neural networks were constructed for each parameter to be recovered, experimenting with different topologies and evaluating their performance.

In this case Segnet model and MLP model were used to make the classification.
